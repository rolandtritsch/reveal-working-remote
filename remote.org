  - ???

* First week

  - Start/stop your day at the same time
    - With the same (30 min) task
    - Something that you like to do
  - Go/get out once a day
    - For a walk, run, work-out or a coffee
  - Learn how to use zoom
  - Learn how to use slack
    - Get the balance right between it (slack) constantly disrupting you and it being your life-line to the rest of the company

* First month

  - Start to do small-talk, chit-chat, coffee-cooler (on slack)
    - Make/take time for it. It's ok to chat! It is important!!!
  - (Over-)Communicate
    - On Slack ("AFK. Going to walk the dog. Back in 30 ...")

* First quarter

** Tools and infrastructure
   - Make sure you have a good internet connection
     - 10Mbit/sec up/down, low latency, high uptime
     - use [[https://fast.com/#][FAST]] to test it
     - Pro tip: Make sure you can turn your phone into a hotspot (as a backup in case your WLAN at home stops working)
   - Make sure you have a [[https://onezero.medium.com/2019s-best-gaming-headsets-4f440261a159][good headset]] (with a good mic)
     - This is not to make your live better, but will improve the experience for everybody that will be on the call with you
     - Pro tip: Do *NOT* get a wireless headset. If you have a call with 10 people and they have wireless headsets one of them will run out of battery in the middle of the call
   - Make sure you have a dedicated, separate workspace
     - A room, a desk, a corner, ...
     - Good chair, good (stand-up) desk, ...
     - Good keyboard, good screen, ...
   - Slack, Zoom, Phone, ...
     - Everything you need to stay connected
     - Pro tip: Use [[https://www.getclockwise.com/][clockwise]] to sync your cal with your slack status (and put everything that you do into your cal; that way you can also see what you have spend your time on)

** Processes and behaviors

   - Set boundaries for yourself
     - Do not work too much (find a way to stop). Do not prograstinate (find a way to start)
       - Put a meeting into your cal to start the day. Put dinner into your cal to stop the day
   - Set boundaries with/for the rest of the family
     - Spouses, kids, dogs, ...
     - I am working from home. That means that you have to stay out of this room from 9am to 12pm and from 1pm to 6pm. If you want/need something, please write it down. We can talk about it at lunch time or during dinner
   - Know yourself
     - Extrovert - will feel frustrated (initially), because you need to (re)learn how to interact
     - Introvert - will like it (initially), but will feel lonely (after a while)
     - Prograstinator - Ooohhh boy ...
     - ???
   - Stop your day with 30 mins, were you plan how you will start your next day (what do you want to achieve by noon the next day)

** Tips and tricks

   - Find a place nearby (20 - 30 mins walking distance) to work from (coffee shop with a good internet connection (test it))
   - Excersise (once a day)

** Resources

   - [[https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job][Awesome]] list

** Meetings

   - Show up on time (and that probably means 2 mins before the call starts)
   - Dial in using laptop (not phones)
   - Use headphones (with boom mic)
   - Video on when possible, you’re a human let’s see your face
   - Test your setup before the meeting (camera, headset, internet, ...)

** Productivity

   - Self-discipline and staying organized
   - Balance being online and available to unblock your teammates vs being heads-down on your own work
   - Favor async communication
     - Tiers of communication? I.e. text for immediate response, Slack for quick response, email for 24hrs+
